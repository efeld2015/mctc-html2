      <p>The Camino de Santiago, or the Way of St. James in English, is a network of pilgrims' ways or pilgrimages leading to the shrine of the apostle James in the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia in northwestern Spain, where tradition holds that the remains of the apostle are buried.
        In this article, I will give a brief overview of this ancient pathway.

      <p>The beauty of the Camino routes is that you can walk as much or as little as you want; you could spend weeks walking from Le Puy to Santiago, one month walking from St Jean Pied de Port, a week or just a few days.</p>
    
    <p>There is a Camino route for everyone but the one thing to keep in mind is that in order to receive your Compostela pilgrim certificate, you will need to walk at least the last 100km into Santiago de Compostela or cycle the last 200km.
